This repository demonstrates a bug where a Firebase Cloud Function triggered by an HTTPS request fails to write data to Firestore. The function executes without error, logs the data successfully, yet the data doesn't appear in the database. The issue is not immediately obvious from error messages. The solution involves checking the function's execution environment and ensuring proper data serialization.
