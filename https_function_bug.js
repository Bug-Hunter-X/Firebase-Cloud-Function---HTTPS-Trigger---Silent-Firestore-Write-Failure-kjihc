In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't being written to Firestore correctly using a Cloud Function triggered by an HTTPS request. The function successfully received the request and logged the data, but the data didn't appear in Firestore.  The function used `admin.firestore().collection('myCollection').add(data)` to write the data. I checked the Firestore rules and they allowed write access.
